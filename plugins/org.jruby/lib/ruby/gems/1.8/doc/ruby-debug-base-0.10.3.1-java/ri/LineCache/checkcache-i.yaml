  body: Discard cache entries that are out of date. If <tt>filename</tt> is <tt>nil</tt>
    all entries in the file cache +@@file_cache+ are checked. If we don't have stat
    information about a file which can happen if the file was read from __SCRIPT_LINES
    but no corresponding file is found, it will be kept. Return a list of invalidated
    filenames. nil is returned if a filename was given but not found cached.
