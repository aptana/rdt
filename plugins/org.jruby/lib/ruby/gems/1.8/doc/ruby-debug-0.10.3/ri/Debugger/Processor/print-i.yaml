  body: Callers of this routine should make sure to use comma to separate format argments
    rather than %. Otherwise it seems that if the string you want to print has format
    specifier, which could happen if you are trying to show say a source-code line
    with &quot;puts&quot; or &quot;print&quot; in it, this print routine will give
    an error saying it is looking for more arguments.
