  body: Return an IO stream for the zipped entry.

  body: 'NOTE: Originally this method used two approaches, Return a GZipReader directly,
    or read the GZipReader into a string and return a StringIO on the string. The
    string IO approach was used for versions of ZLib before 1.2.1 to avoid buffer
    errors on windows machines. Then we found that errors happened with 1.2.1 as well,
    so we changed the condition. Then we discovered errors occurred with versions
    as late as 1.2.3. At this point (after some benchmarking to show we weren''t seriously
    crippling the unpacking speed) we threw our hands in the air and declared that
    this method would use the String IO approach on all platforms at all times. And
    that''s the way it is.'
