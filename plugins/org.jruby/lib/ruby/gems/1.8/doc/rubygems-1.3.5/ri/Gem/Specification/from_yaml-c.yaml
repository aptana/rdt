- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Special loader for YAML files. When a Specification object is loaded from
    a YAML file, it bypasses the normal Ruby object initialization routine (#initialize).
    This method makes up for that and deals with gems of different ages.

  body: '''input'' can be anything that YAML.load() accepts: String or IO.'
