- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Return a list of the specifications in the dependency list, sorted in order
    so that no spec in the list depends on a gem earlier in the list.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: This is useful when removing gems from a set of installed gems. By removing
    them in the returned order, you don't get into as many dependency issues.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: If there are circular dependencies (yuck!), then gems will be returned in
    order until only the circular dependents and anything they reference are left.
    Then arbitrary gemspecs will be returned until the circular dependency is broken,
    after which gems will be returned in dependency order again.
