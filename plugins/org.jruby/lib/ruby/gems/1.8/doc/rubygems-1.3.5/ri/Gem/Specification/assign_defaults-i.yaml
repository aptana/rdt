  body: Each attribute has a default value (possibly nil). Here, we initialize all
    attributes to their default value. This is done through the accessor methods,
    so special behaviours will be honored. Furthermore, we take a <em>copy</em> of
    the default so each specification instance has its own empty arrays, etc.
