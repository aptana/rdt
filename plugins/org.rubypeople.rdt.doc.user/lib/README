The saxon lib was downloaded from http://saxon.sourceforge.net/.
It has been modified not to prvide AElfred as XML parser by removing
the jar file entry META-INF/services/javax.xml.parsers.SAXParserFactory.

Aelfred seems to have a problem resolving the DTD mods. When  
using an xmlcatalog for the docbook DTD, it produces the following  
errormessage:

java.net.MalformedURLException: no protocol: dbnotnx.mod

: Fatal Error! 
Failure reading file:///C:/workspaces/rdt-subversive-workspace/org.rubypeople.rdt.doc.user/docbook.xml 
Cause: java.net.MalformedURLException: no protocol: dbnotnx.mod
