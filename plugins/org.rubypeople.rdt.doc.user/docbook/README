Place the docbook dtd's and xsl scripts as zip file into this directory.
The build process will unpack the xsl zip file into a folder docbook-xsl
(by renaming the original directory entry which contains the version
number). The dtds will be extracted into the folder dtd.

Download the xsl files from http://sourceforge.net/projects/docbook/
and the docbook dtds from http://www.docbook.org/xml.
